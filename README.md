## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

In this project I created a password generator that needed to follow a specific set of criteria. Once criteria was selected, it generates a password in the text box provided. If the password was less than 8 characters or more than 128 it does not generate password. If there were no options selected between lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and numbers, then the user is prompted to select as least one of those options.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Generate a random password for more secure username/password combinations on the internet. This helps prevent malicious parties from accessing your accounts.
