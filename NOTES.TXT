// Prompt w/ validation to see how many characters they want (length of password) between 8 and 128 characters
// Confirm - ask if they want special characters in the password
// Confirm - uppercase
//Confirm - lowercase
//Confirm numeric
// Validate that at least 1 of the 4 options for speical characters/etc is true
// If false alert saying they need to pick one of these, then re-ask those 4 questions
// If they pick one of them (1/4 = true) then generate password

//Generate promps that pop up where you can type in how many characters you want to put in, do you want to include special characters? numberic characters? uppercase? how long? how long would be a promp, the others would be confirm

//use that input from the user to create the password.

//Use pseudocode - explain step by step in regular language so you can follow progress.

//prompt user for length

//promt user for all character selections to confirm all

//error handling (did they enter a valid number)

//error handling (did user select at least one option)

//use inputs to generate password

//return the password from the generate password function in either an alert or display in text box

//you can leave the pseudo-code comments and write the particular thing underneath them so you know where you are and what each one does

//gives you a path to follow to get to the end

//use Math.floor() and Math.random() to generate random number
